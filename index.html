	"Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
	In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: 
	<br>
 
	Who, being in very nature God,
		did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
	<br>
	rather, he made himself nothing
		by taking the very nature of a servant,
		being made in human likeness.
	<br>
		And being found in appearance as a man,
			he humbled himself
			by becoming obedient to death”
			even death on a cross!
	<br>
		Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
		and gave him the name that is above every name,
	<br>
		that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
		in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
	<br>
		and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
			to the glory of God the Father."
	</i> <br> <br>
	Phillipians 2:1-11
